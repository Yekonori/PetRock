    text: "And well, they used to say \u201CSky is the limit\u201D. But was it ever
      truly the case? Humankind never liked limits to begin with. It only thought
      of them as challenges, something that they had yet to overcome."

      - no, had to cross. And for what reason?

      further, always pursuing an everdistant dream.
